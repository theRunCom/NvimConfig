My Personal Neovim Configuration 🛠️

I. Introduction 🆕

Traditionally, Vim has been perceived as having a steep learning curve. Configuring Neovim from scratch is also extremely challenging, requiring considerable effort and patience.

However, numerous pre-configured setups and frameworks are available online that can instantly transform Neovim from a basic text editor into a fully-fledged IDE. Examples include LunarVim, NvChad, and AstroVim.

My choice, however, is **Lazyvim**! Lazyvim is a modern, highly customizable open-source configuration framework based on Neovim. Neovim is a fork of Vim that offers more features and an improved user experience. Lazyvim aims to simplify Neovim's configuration and plugin management, making it easier for users to use and customize their editing environment.

LazyVim is a Neovim configuration powered by [💤 lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), allowing for easy customization and extension of your setup. Instead of choosing between starting from scratch or using a pre-made distribution, LazyVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility to adjust your configuration as needed, along with the convenience of default pre-configuration.
